David Beeson and Nick Nguyen

Nick:
We coded together for much of the project including modifying the runserver.py program, and the index.html file. I covered most of the scipt.js file, but we worked together to make sure that we had an understanding of AJAX and mustache. I also covered most of the testing.

David: 
Like Nick mentioned, we coded together alot on the runserver.py and index.html file. While nick handled most of the script.js, I helped form some of the html strings within the js and also kept up to understand AJAX and mustache. I also led us on the botstrap components of the index.html file. I also then handled the pylint, and tried to help out on the error testing front too, though Nick did most of that. 

Outside help (people): None

Outside help (resources): 
https://github.com/janl/mustache.js - mustache for our index.html file

We spent around 18 hours on this asignment

We think the assignment was helpful in locking down our understanding of html and js frameworks like bootstrap, AJAX, and mustache. We think it could've used a little more open ended creativity through the actual design of the page instead of following a laid out design, but this framework was helpful too.
