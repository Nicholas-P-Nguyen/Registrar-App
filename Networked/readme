With respect to I/O and compute delays, under what circumstances is regserver.py better than regserverprelim.py?

Regserver.py handles the iodelays much better than regserverprelim.py, because the program can just switch threads when there is an iodelay. So it is not effected by the iodelays.

Regserver doesn't handle computer delays much better than regserverprelim.py because the processor is consumed, so switching threads doesn't allow more processing to take place
